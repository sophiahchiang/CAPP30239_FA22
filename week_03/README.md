## Covid graph

Script.js and index.html files which we wrote in class to display a bar chart of covid cases (data in covid.csv)

## Data

The data in the data folder is a compilation of Spotify playlists. I got the data using Spotify's public API. I am interested in this topic because music is one of my favorite things. I grew up surrounded by music and it has only become a bigger and bigger part of my life. I am curious to understand what sorts of trends exist within Spotify playlists and whether certain types of music are more strongly represented on the Spotify platform as a whole. I am also interested in characteristics such as the distribution of Spotify playlist length, the age of featured artists, musical trends over time, averaged musical preferences, and how my personal music taste fits into this grander picture. I chose to investigate playlists specifically because they seem like a good vehicle for capturing a wide variety of music. However, I am still concerned that these data may not be an accurate snapshot of what people are listening to on Spotify. I consider this a primary data source because I scraped the data directly from Spotify. 

Data source: Spotify, spotify.com
