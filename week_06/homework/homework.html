        <h1>Chart 1: Timeline</h1>
        <p>
        I was interested in whether there was any relationship betwen the season
        and the number of deaths. I was able to examine this 
        trend by graphing number of deaths over time. Consistent with my hypothesis, 
        we see that there is a rise in number of deaths as it gets warmer, 
        during the months of April through May. However because we are only looking at
        data pulled from 2015 we have no idea whether this is a fluke or whether 
        the trend holds up across multiple years. The decrease we see in the below
        line graph from September onwards could be a decrease that continues 
        throughout 2016 even as the weather changes.

        <h1>Chart 2: Age Distribution</h1>
        <p>
        This chart illustrates the age distribution of those who were shot 
        in 2015. I chose to use a histogram because it is a concise way of
        examining this data point. It is easy to tell where the bulk
        of the people are. Most fall within the ages of 25 and 35. After that, 
        the number of people shot begins to decrease in a fairly linear fashion
        which is interesting. In other words, it seems that the older you are, 
        the less likely you are to be shot. This correlation is not unexpected.
        It might also be useful to have an idea of the criminal history of each 
        person included in this data set in order to shed light on why it 
        is that the bulk of people shot fall into the specified age range. Perhaps
        people in that younger age bracket tend to engage in more illicit or dangerous
        acitivities which increases the likelihood of them being killed.

        <h1>Chart 3: Race Breakdown</h1>
        <p>
        This pie chart shows us the race breakdown of the 2015 sample. I was curious 
        to see whether a certain group was more prominently represented,
        and it turns out that White people make up almost half of the entire sample.
        I wonder if this is a product of overall population trendsâ€”in other words 
        is it because the population in the US is predominantly White
        that more White people were shot relative to any other race? We can attempt to address this question
        by comparing the race breakdown of this sample size of people shot with the 
        greater race breakdown of the US at the time this sample was taken, in 2015.
